; YAPYAP SCRIPT
;
; This is a modified script based on a script used used in a 1965 pilot study
; by Quarton, McGuire and Lorch titled
;
; MAN-MACHINE NATURAL LANGUAGE EXCHANGES BASED ON SELECTED FEATURES OF
;                      UNRESTRICTED INPUT-I.
;           THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TIME-SHARED COMPUTER
;       AS A RESEARCH TOOL IN STUDYING DYADIC COMMUNICATION
;
; The script is compatible with Joseph Weizenbaum's 1966 ELIZA as described
; in his 1966 CACM paper. To achieve this compatibility, the "forced-choice"
; parts of the original script have been removed, and occurrences of "END)"
; replaced with the appropriate number of closing parenthesis.
;
; The original script source is the file
; "501.05_12_28_1967 Printout of computer script + Papers/
;  by McGuire et al_includes HG notes.pdf"
; from the Garfinkel archive.
