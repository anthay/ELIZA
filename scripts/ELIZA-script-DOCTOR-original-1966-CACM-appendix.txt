;
; APPENDIX. An Eliza Script
;
; Transcribed from Joseph Weizenbaum's article on page 36 of the January
; 1966 edition of Communications of the ACM titled 'ELIZA - A Computer
; Program For the Study of Natural Language Communication Between Man And
; Machine'.
;
; "Keywords and their associated transformation rules constitute the
; SCRIPT for a particular class of conversation. An important property of
; ELIZA is that a script is data; i.e., it is not part of the program
; itself." -- From the above mentioned article.
;
; Transcribed by Anthony Hay, December 2020
;
;
; Notes
;
; This is a verbatim transcription of the ELIZA script in the above
; mentioned CACM article, with the following caveats:
; a) Whitespace has been added to help reveal the structure of the
;    script.
; b) In the appendix six lines were printed twice adjacent to each other
;    (with exactly 34 lines between each duplicate), making the structure
;    nonsensical. These duplicates have been commented out of this
;    transcription.
; c) There were no comments in the script in the CACM article.
;
;
; Weizenbaum says "An ELIZA script consists mainly of a set of list
; structures..." and that ELIZA was written in MAD-Slip. He didn't publish
; it at the time, but a version of the source code has now been found in
; the Weizenbaum archives at MIT. See elizagen.org.
