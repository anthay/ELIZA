; Transcript of an ELIZA script printed in a listing preceeding the ELIZA
; source code in MIT archive document 02-000311051.pdf. The listing was
; found in a folder titled COMPUTER CONVERSATIONS 1965 and has the header
;
;    "PRINT,T0109,2531,.TAPE.,102      T0109 2531    1748.8     03/06"
;
; The date the listing was printed is therefore assumed to be 6 March 1965.
;
; This is a verbatim transcript except for whitespace, which has been
; changed for readability.
;
; NOTE: This script is not well formed: the list (DON'T YOU KNOW), which
; should probably be in the list of reassemble rules for the keyword PERHAPS,
; is instead located at the keyword level.
